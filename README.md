# Zhuia

![logo-zhuia](static/logo.png)

An elegant but still playful theme for [Zola](https://getzola.org/) powered by [Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/).

It is especially optimized for mobile navigation (optionally without JavaScript, if you don't like fancy stuff).

**DEMO**: [https://zhuia.netlify.app/](https://zhuia.netlify.app/)

## Options

### Title

Set a title and description in the config to appear in the site header and on the RSS feed:

```toml
title = "Der Prozess"
description = "a novel written by Franz Kafka in 1914"
```

### SEO

Most SEO tags are populated by the page metadata, but you can set the `author` and for the `og:image` tag provide the path to an image:

```toml
[extra]

author = "Timothy Morton"
og_image = "Hyperobjects.png"
```

### Menu
You can choose between two modes:
- With a small script for an elegant overlay menu
- Without any scripts at all (it just your show menu underneath)

### Social

Set a field in `extra` with a key of `footer_links`:

```toml
[extra]

# Freely comment out or delete every field
social_links = [
    {url = "https://t.me/yourname", name = "telegram"},
    {url = "https://twitter.com/gicrisf", name = "twitter"},
    {url = "https://github.com/gicrisf", name = "github"},
    # {url = "", name = "facebook"},
    # {url = "", name = "instagram"},
    # {url = "", name = "bookstack"},
    # {url = "", name = "dokuwiki"},
]
```

![social buttons](social-buttons.png)

The theme automatically picks up the right icons.
We can expand the support to other social, for sure: make a PR or open an enhancement issue to ask a new implementation.

### Footer

You can add your own copyright or whatever to the footer with a through a simple option on the config file:

```toml
[extra]

footer_tagline = "What if everything is an illusion and nothing exists? In that case, I definitely overpaid for my carpet."
```

## Name

The name arise from two parts:
- The generator, Zola, gives the "Z";
- An extinct species of New Zealand wattlebird, the huia, provide the second part.

The theme is built on **Spectre** CSS framework, so I found reasonable evoking a **spectral species**.

## Genesis

This theme is based on a Pelican theme I originally made for my blog, which was in turn based on the 
Grav theme [Quark](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-quark).
